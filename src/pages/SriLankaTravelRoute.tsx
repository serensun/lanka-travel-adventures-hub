          Sri Lanka's transportation system mostly relies on a road network, concentrated around the country's business city, Colombo. A rail network serves a portion of Sri Lanka's transportation needs. Three international airports are located at Jaffna, Hambantota, and Katunayake, 35 kilometers (22 mi) north of Colombo, along with navigable canals and harbors.
        </p>

        <p>
          Streets represent roughly 93% of Sri Lanka's land transport. Sri Lanka's road network is roughly 12,000 kilometers (7,500 mi), comprising A- and B-class streets and 151.8 kilometers (94.3 mi) of expressways. The main transport modes in Sri Lanka are buses, passenger automobiles and motorcycles.

          The number of inquiries such as "What is the best travel route in Sri Lanka?" and "What is the best trip to Sri Lanka?" has been constantly rising. We thought of producing this essay expanding on various renowned travel routes in Sri Lanka that you should only hit once in a lifetime. This list features 14 travel routes, and we will be adding more in the future. I believe this information is quite beneficial, not only for local travelers but also for outsiders. If you plan a short Sri Lanka trip, such as a one-day trip, choosing the optimal travel route is crucial to the success of your trip because you need to minimize the time spent commuting and spend maximum time experiencing the places.

        <p>
          A short journey means you have very little time for sightseeing, therefore, saving time on travel is quite vital. Even if it is a multi-day Sri Lanka trip, such as a 5-day Sri Lanka tour or a 1-week Sri Lanka trip, minimizing the time on the road means you can add many additional interesting destinations that are not previously included in your trip.

        <p>
          This is a very convenient weekend gateway from Colombo. A road trip from Sri Lanka to Matara is an activity that most local residents are fond of, which provides a perfect setting for a peaceful beach tour of Sri Lanka. Don't forget to go whale- and dolphin-watching in Mirissa and beach-hopping on the beaches. The picturesque palm-fringed beaches and shallow-torque waters of the Indian Ocean calm those jittery nerves.

        <p>
          A perfect travel route for a Sri Lanka 3-day tour through the tea country. The graceful blend of Sri Lanka's hill country's beautifully landscaped tea garden and cascading waterfalls of perennial waterways in Nuwara Eliya is a sight to behold.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The city's sheer beauty surprises the newcomers. The breathtaking scenery along the trip from Nuwara Eliya to Kandy completely mystifies the travelers.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The winding roads, high elevation, and healing climate of the hills make it a fantastic road tour of Sri Lanka that will etch a permanent spot in your heart for an eternity.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          You traverse the mountain terrain, and it is a challenging ride that requires your best attention, but the beauty of this Sri Lanka trip hides the uncertainty of the terrain. If you drive to Nuwara Eliya from the airport or from Colombo, this is the most convenient way of reaching your destination. The drive is long; however, it is very enjoyable as you drive along with the lush green vegetation.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Road trip conditions: The road spans 176 km through the mountains. A sharp increase in the road's elevation starts in Awissawella and ends at an altitude of 1800 meters above sea level in Nuwara Eliya. The journey will take around a day with sightseeing stops. The best time to visit is from November to April.

        <p>
          This road is currently one of the best on the island, and I highly recommend embarking on a trip along this wonderful route. You start your journey on the west coast and end your tour on the east coast of Sri Lanka, at the country's widest point. Arugambay is a popular beach resort in Sri Lanka; perhaps it is the most popular on the east coast. The pristine beaches in Arugam Bay are ideal for beachcombing and surfing. However, Aru Gam Bay is a seasonal beach resort, and the best time of year to visit Aru Gam Bay is in May, June, July, and October. Arugam Bay is considered one of the best places to visit in Sri Lanka in July due to the dry and sunny weather.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The journey will take around 8 hours without stopping, so calculate the time required for the tour with all the stops for sightseeing and other breaks along the way. The trek to Arugambe from Colombo is one of the most popular activities among road trip lovers in Sri Lanka. If you have good driving stamina, you will be able to reach Arugam Bay within 2 days with excursions to significant tourist places.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This will be a highly gorgeous and experience-rich road trip to Sri Lanka. You will meet mountains, escapements, pockets of forests, beaches and any other geographical conditions possible on the island.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This road from Kandy to Arugambe via Bibile is one of the most magnificent trips through forests in Sri Lanka that you will ever take. Plan your motorbike road trip so that you can enjoy the refreshing, unpolluted air in this greenish area.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Road trip conditions: The road covers 329 km through the middle mountain range. You start the journey from lower, raised parts on the west coast and end the excursion at the east coast beaches, while halfway along the track you will touch the point, which is 500 meters above sea level.

          This is a highly attractive Sri Lanka travel route through some of the least populated places in the central province. You drive a big part of your trip through the wildlife reserve, and there is a strong probability of witnessing wild elephants as you travel from Puttalam to Saliyawewa.

        <p>
          Route travel conditions: The route stretches 207 km in northwest Sri Lanka and makes an abrupt turn inland at Puttalam. The journey takes roughly 4 hours. You can meet modest traffic between Colombo and Puttalam, after which the route becomes empty. Be careful, as you will have to travel through the forested areas after Puttalam. It is best to avoid traveling at night on this Sri Lanka travel route because of the wild elephants.

        <p>
          This is another popular Sri Lankan travel route from Colombo to the east coast of Sri Lanka. This is the most convenient way to reach Trincomalee from Colombo. On this road trip, the travelers avoid going through the central mountain range, and their destination is located more to the northeast of Sri Lanka.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The reason this is a well-liked route for foreign visitors is that a lot of people visit the beaches of Trincomalee in July, August, September, and October each year. One of the busiest roads in Sri Lanka, it passes through several densely populated cities, including Kurunegala and Dambulla.

In addition to the numerous fascinating sites to explore in Landy, Kandy is one of the most well-known UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the nation. With a wealth of tourist attractions, Kandy is one of the most well-liked mountain travel destinations. It is thought that Kandy ought to be included in every Sri Lankan travel package.<br />Sri Lanka's cultural hub and most sought-after vacation spot is Kandy. The main transportation hub for the central province, Kandy connects major cities and regions of the nation. As a result, most of the roads that lead to Kandy are extremely congested, particularly the one that runs from Colombo to Kandy.<br />The amount of time you lose in traffic must be factored into your road trip itinerary.

Ratnapura itself is a city in the woods and claims to be a part of the country's most valuable forest patch, known as the Sinharaja Rain Forest. If you are venturing on a Sinharja rainforest tour package from Colombo, this could be the best route for you.<br />The foliage becomes denser as you approach Ratnapura, and the enormous trees on either side of the road form a canopy. Ratnapura is a major city on the island with high rainfall, so it often goes underwater during the monsoon rain.<br />Check the weather before you start this road trip. And plan your trip with at least 2 days of sightseeing in the area; here you get waterfalls, rainforests, trekking sites, museums, and many, many more.<br />Road trip conditions: It will take around 2 hours to cover this short stretch of 75 km, which makes for an enjoyable road trip.

        <h2>9. Sri Lanka travel route from Colombo to Bandarawela</h2>

        <p>This is the ideal itinerary for a 2-day or 3-day tour in Sri Lanka. Any Sri Lankan citizen will be familiar with the name Bandarawela, and it is also very well-liked by tourists from other countries who are enamored with the area's soothing climate and stunning mountains. However, Bandarawela is one of the most beaten-track tourist places in Sri Lanka for most foreign travelers.<br />Bandarawela is one of the most picturesque spots on the island, including mountains, valleys, tea gardens, and sections of forests. Bandarawela also hides a large number of cascading waterfalls, and some of them are simply difficult to miss, such as the Diyaluma Falls.<br />The most remarkable characteristic of Bandarawela is its healing climate, where the overnight temperature occasionally drops to freezing. During the day, the temperature hovers about 25 degrees Celsius.<br />This route from Colombo to Bandarawela via Ratnapura is by far the easiest road to get there. One notable aspect of this off-the-beaten-path Sri Lanka travel route is the lack of traffic compared to the other popular Sri Lanka route (Colombo-Kandy-Ella-Bandarawela), which leads to Bandarawela. The road is also in pretty good shape, which means you may speed up, but be careful with the bends.<br />The road generally goes through rural areas, with only a handful of vibrant cities coming into view. You also travel along the magnificent mountains and valleys to appreciate the breathtaking environment. Tea plantations dominate the lovely green countryside for a large section of the route. However, this upcountry road is tiny compared to most important travel routes in Sri Lanka and grows substantially steeper beyond Ratnapura.</p>

Travelers favor this route as one of the most popular in Sri Lanka because of Sigiriya's reputation as a historical landmark. This excursion can be continued eastward to Kalkuda and Pasikudah, or it can be extended to Polonnaruwa. Beginning in Colombo, the Sigiriya, Dambulla, and Polonnaruwa Tour is a well-liked one-day itinerary.<br />Kurunegala is the main road along which one travels from Colombo to Sigiriya. This is the finest route to follow when traveling from Colombo to Sigiriya. Except in large towns, the road is in excellent condition and is not very congested.

        <h2>12. Travel routes in Sri Lanka: Mirissa to Colombo or the Beach Lovers route</h2>

        <p>This leisurely day excursion from Colombo to the southern region of Sri Lanka follows the coastal railway's path, which links some of the nation's most popular beach resorts with some of the island's most ancient cities. While there won't be much quiet during the busy season, there will be plenty of sun-kissed sand and respectable places to dine, stay, and surf.<br />Start your trip in Colombo, the ancient capital of Sri Lanka, where you may visit temples and marketplaces and eat a five-star restaurant's crab curry. Following that, travel south to the beaches of Bentota and Aluthgama, stopping along the way to admire the breathtaking Brief Garden inland. There are some of the most opulent Ayurvedic treatment resorts in all of Sri Lanka along this length of coastline, if you can afford them. Ambalangoda is a terrific spot to learn about the island's distinctive kolam rituals, while Hikkaduwa is a great area to spend a day or two having fun in the ocean.<br />The streets of Galle, a World Heritage Site, are surrounded by a historic lighthouse and a fortification built by the Dutch colonists. Once you've had a filling supper and spent a comfortable night in the ancient district, head towards the beach resort of Unawatuna, the surfing destinations of Midigama and Weligama, and make time to explore the Handunugoda Tea Estate before reaching the distinctly Sri Lankan town of Matara.<br />Interesting locations along the route for beach lovers</p>

        <h2>13. One of the finest routes to travel in Sri Lanka is from Colombo to Badulla via the hill country/tea loving route.</h2>

        <p><br />Travelers can take a road trip across Sri Lanka's picturesque hill country using this route. In actuality, this is Sri Lanka's most well-liked rainy travel route. One of the most beautiful train rides in the world is available on this route.<br />You'll be persuaded by the journey along this path that Sri Lanka is home to attractions beyond its beaches.

Travel inland on the A1 highway from the city center to Kandy, the location of Sri Lanka's holiest temple. En route, make multiple stops to enjoy the surrounding scenery.<br />Before heading out to the actual tea valley, you may make stops at a number of stunning gardens and temples on the outskirts of the city if you rent a car and hire a driver. Discover the jade-green tea fields that border the mountain road leading to Nuwara Eliya, passing through estates like Glenloch en route. There are several options available in Nuwara Eliya at a range of price points for lodging.<br />Continue to Haputale, the home of tea mogul Sir Thomas Lipton, and make a stop at Lipton's factory in Dambatenne before continuing over the magnificent Horton Plains. After that, make your way past more breathtaking vistas and into Ella, where you can unwind in a guesthouse and savor some traditional Sri Lankan cuisine. We'll leave it up to you whether or not you want to snap an Instagram picture of the Nine Arches Bridge outside of town.</p>

        <h2>15. Route for travelers interested in wildlife from Mirissa to Aru Gam Bay, Sri Lanka</h2>

        <p>This island-hopping journey includes trips to both well-known and lesser-known national parks in addition to an offshore whale-watching expedition to find the largest wild mammal in the world. That's actually what you do as soon as you get to the southern seaside resort of Mirissa. The main attraction inland is the Sinharaja Forest Reserve's avian inhabitants, which you can explore on foot with a local guide.<br />See elephants at Uda Walawe National Park (less crowded than Yala National Park) to the east, and then make your way back to the coast to visit the dunes and lagoons of Bundala National Park to observe birdlife. You'll need to make an inland loop to go to Kumana National Park, where you can improve your chances of seeing a leopard; this is much easier if you have a car and driver rather than taking public transit. Before ending the day, spend some time surfing at Arugam Bay.</p>

        <h2>When is the ideal time to take a southern route road trip?</h2>

        <p>The optimum time to visit Sri Lanka via the southern route is between November and April. The majority of the nation stays dry and gets its recommended daily amount of sunshine over these six months. Beach vacationers have found that November through April, especially on the beaches on the west and south coast, have been good. Sea bathing, diving, snorkeling, yachting, and other saltwater-based sports are all safe in the ocean.</p>
